# SnipItGenerator
Just a tool we made to help us quickly copy generated templates into a workspace directly by copying snippets of code and pasting them with Ctrl + V. Supports multiple filetypes and the only prompting instruction needed is that the first line comment must end with the filename and extension so this program can properly name it and set the extension: Prompt ex: "First line of all generated code files must start with a comment that ends with 'filename.extensiion' with a space ' ' prior to it in the comment: //src/ Header.js, /* src/components/ Tile.css */, or #PyFile Counter.py"
